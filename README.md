# WBosonAnalysis_ReferToATLAS
#The Code I am using in report 2 is succeeding the ATLAS python framework in use of pyroot. 
#Instead of completely using the downloaded zip file, which is merely relating to HZZAnalysis, I utilized four other python file (includes TupleReader.py, #WBosonAnalysis.py, WBosonConfiguration.py, and PlotConf_WBosonAnalysis.py) provided by Professor Casper. 

#In addition, I made some adjustment for debugging such as revising information input file, and added up the fitting code for question 2 and question 3. I closed #the isTightID() function in WBosonAnalysis.py to reselect event and fill the new histogram. 
#Most of the analysis in report I referred the Paper Measurement of W± and Z-boson production cross sections in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV with the ATLAS #detector, which is assigned on Canvas and has been cited in paper.
